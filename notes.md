# Tower Story

### Wtf i s this

A 3D SimTower, basically... it would be cool to have a "Story" be traceable via the denizens, if not playable, but perhaps injectable. Perhaps one person needs a certain kind of store to open up to help them get closer to another person, and when you do that their story progresses. Maybe it's an upfront way to move gameplay along, maybe it's a easter egg type thing.

Also, "story" is a decent pun here given stories in a building but... yeah.

"Story" could also be a decent moniker for a series of games (Farm Story etc)

But mostly, a 3D Sim Tower.

I would love to have a "base" game, a vanilla tower builder that focuses on the basics, but have an open "modding" system to make my own tropico tower style game afterwards on top of, if it's possible.

The modding opportunity for others would be cool, it would be a neat programming challenge for me, plus it is an opportunity to try and not just make two games, but to really cleanly separate systems from content and really think about those layers of abstraction well before most do.

I do think Godot offers a neat way to do this all with the editor, or perhaps by adjusting the editor -- which is something that I should find far more approachable now that I've futzed with C++ somewhat. It may be a good idea to start contributing open source aid eventually to Godot etc.

Anyway, the game.
